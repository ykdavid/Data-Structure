Grading process: 

* Review auto-graded tests
  * Review the test file. Students should NOT have changed the provided tests, but may have added more tests
  * I believe this assignment doesn't have the same non-deterministic things earlier assignments do; tests should work
* Review the write-up 
  * The write-up should be in `README.md`
  * Original instructions should be in `instructions.md`
